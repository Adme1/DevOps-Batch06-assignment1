Agile: Whole deployment cycle is divided into small sprints, each sprint consists of independent cycle of 
Discover | Plan | Build | Review
DevOps: Devops is all about creating a mechanism to  getting the code from developer's machine
and depolyng it to production. This process contains automation while creating CI/CD pipelines.


Q#2: Define CI, Continuous Delivery & Continuous Deployment
In CI/CD (Development) automated pipeline is made all the way to the staging environment meanwhile
deployment on production is done manually whereas CI/CD (Deployment) the pipeline goes all the way
to the production deployment of the code.
